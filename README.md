Weight Prediction Model
This project aims to develop a regression model to predict an individual's weight based on various factors. Utilizing statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the model identifies relationships between weight and influencing variables.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have R installed. Then, install the required packages:

R
Copy
Edit
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "caret", "readxl"))
Running the Analysis
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/AbuzarMeh/Weight-prediction-model.git
cd Weight-prediction-model
Open Stats.R:

Use RStudio or any R environment to open and run the Stats.R script.

This script will load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, train the regression model, and output the evaluation metrics.

📊 Model Evaluation
The regression model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and residual analysis. Visualizations are generated to assess the model's fit and identify any patterns in the residuals.
